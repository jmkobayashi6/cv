 <p class="about_descrip">My background is in operations, entrepreneurship, and engineering.
   I have strong technical and analytical skills, although my primary focus is people and building
   relationships within a team. Since I have graduated with a Master's in Engineering Leadership specializing
   in Integrated Water Management, I have dedicated my time to water sustainability projects. I am currently
   advancing my skill sets in technology to apply to water treatment optimization projects. My core belief is
   that the combination of innovative technology and good people is the solution to the world's future challenges.</p>
